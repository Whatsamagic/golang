Final programming exercise on Tero Karvinens intensive Go programming course https://terokarvinen.com/2020/go-programming-course-2020-w22/

guitar.go prints the 12 frets of guitar and displays notes per each string on standard tuning.
Program starts with rough sketch of a guitar with 12 frets (beyond this the same notes will just repeat on each string)
There are currently three available functions:
1) make user guess a random note on fretboard
2) show same tone on all over fretboard
3) show all notes on guitar fretboard

Program is aimed for learning the notes on guitar fretboard.
